## Setup Instructions

### Containers

We've also included Postgres and Redis containers. To spin them up, use:

```
docker compose up -d
```

which will start a Postgres container on `localhost:5432` and a Redis container on `localhost:6379`.

### Starting the dev server

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### IDE

Any IDE/Code Editor of your choice will suffice, but my recommendation is Visual Studio Community.
